# Kernel bindings are provided by the kernel build system during compilation
# The actual kernel crate comes from KDIR/rust/bindings/lib.rs
# This dependency is resolved at build time by the kernel Makefile
#
# For TI kernel (ti-linux-kernel):
# 1. Clone: git clone https://git.ti.com/git/ti-linux-kernel/ti-linux-kernel.git
# 2. Checkout branch: git checkout ti-linux-6.12.y (or appropriate version)
# 3. Configure with CONFIG_RUST=y (if Rust support is available)
# 4. Point KDIR to the cloned TI kernel source
#
# For local development/testing with actual kernel crate:
# Uncomment one of the options below and adjust paths as needed:
#
# Option 1: Use local kernel source (path to kernel's rust directory):
# [dependencies.kernel]
# path = "/path/to/kernel-source/rust"
#
# Option 2: Use rust-for-linux upstream (if your kernel doesn't have Rust support):

# Note: The kernel crate is typically provided by the kernel build system during
# module compilation. These options are for standalone testing/development.
