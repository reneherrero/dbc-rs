# Rust toolchain configuration for dbc-rs
#
# This file ensures consistent formatting across all developers.
# Cargo and rustup will automatically use this toolchain when present.
#
# Formatting (rustfmt): Uses this pinned MSRV version for consistency.
# Clippy: Should use latest stable (see pre-commit hook and CI) for better linting.
